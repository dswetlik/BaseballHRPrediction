    "We are going to attempt to accurately predict the amount of homeruns that will occur for the MLB 2021 Season. Since the season has already been completed and thus all the homeruns that can occur in the 2021 season have already happened, we have a fine measurement as to just how accurate our model will be."

    "We are using data from the 2000-2020 seasons on players hitting stats organized by year. This dataset was obtained from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ using the 2020 - comma delimited version. This gives a mountain of different datasets, from which we pulled the Batting.csv dataset. The Batting.csv dataset had data on batters starting in the year 1871, which we have determined isn't exactly helpful when trying to determine more modern baseball statistics, thus our version of Batting.csv found at https://github.com/dswetlik/BaseballHRPrediction/blob/master/Batting.csv has been cut down from 1.5 centuries to 2 decades."

    "Our process for modeling will be fairly straightforward; we will do an ordinary least squares fit utilizing all of the predictors to get the p-values. After that, we will determine collinearity values using a VIF analysis. Then, we will perform subset selection using multiple techniques like forward subset selection. Finally, we will use that model to predict the amount of homeruns the next year and assess our accuracy."

    "An initial disclaimer, the 2020 season was drastically shorter than every other season in the dataset due to the global pandemic and therefore the sample size is much smaller. However, we expect that the decrease in homeruns and games played will also be reflected in the other predictors proportionately so that it can still be reliably used as data."

    "It appears that there is a general upwards trend in homeruns hit each year with a steep decrease in 2020 because COVID-19 shortened the season dramatically. We expect to see all of the predictors values to reflect this decrease proportionately. In 2021, it is expected that the number of homeruns will return to the rising trend over the last decade. In the baseball community, this has become known as the \"live ball era\" because of the upwards trend in homeruns. "
